DATA STRUCTURES (Suggested)

  hashed list array (contiguous memory)
    hash of primary key (must be string)
    hash with 2 functions ("good" and "bad")
    collisions will be resolved in "linear probe" like method (see below)

  2 binary search trees
    1 bst for primary key
    1 bst for secondary key

  a "good" hash function reduces number of possible collisions

  collision resolving method alternates between positive and negative index offsets from home address
  algorithm :
    if home is full
      loop (offset = 1)
        try home + offset
          exit loop on success
        if offset < 0
          offset * -1 + 1
        else
          (offset + 1) * -1

  need to draw a data structure diagram of the hashed array and two bst

  Suggested Assignments splits work to 5 Units
    Unit 1 - Team coordinator (Structure Design and managers)
    Unit 2 - BST Algorithms
    Unit 3 - Hash list algorithms
    Unit 4 - Screen Output
    Unit 5 - File I/O
